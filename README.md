# Soundcloud Playroom

This music sharing application uses Soundcloud API services. Using React/Redux, HTML5 audio web API and firebase, users can combine their favorite playlists into a “playroom” with 4-digit passcode so that the users can add, update and stream tracks in the playroom. No more worrying about who will be the DJ for the night anymore!
